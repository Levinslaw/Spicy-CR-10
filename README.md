# Spicy CR-10

_A very hot bedslinger_

Started out as Creatlity CR-10 V2

Current specifications:

- Hotend Temperature: 500C max using Chube Air and a custom heatbreak air manifold fed by a Berd air pump outside the heated volume, (1) PT-1000, 100W heater cart
- Bed Temperature: 240C tested max using 120 VAC, 1200 watt silicone heater with red RTV (no PSA)
- Heated chamber: 150C max (135C nominal, printer component limitation)
  
Currently working with a Danger Klipper module for heated part cooling control that will allow both fan speed and the heater core temp to be changed independently
