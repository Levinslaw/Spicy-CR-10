# Spicy CR-10

_A very hot bedslinger, once a Creality CR-10 V2_

## Current Specifications

### Temperatures:

- **Hotend:** 500C max
- **Bed:** 240°C max (tested)
- **Build chamber:** 150°C max (135°C nominal, component limitation)

Currently working with a Danger Klipper module for heated part cooling control that will allow both fan speed and the heater core temp to be changed independently.
