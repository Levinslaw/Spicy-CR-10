## Environmental control strategies

    Process parameter control is everything in additive manufacturing wherein anisotropic properties are intrinsic to the technology. The environmental controls constitute everything between the toolhead's nozzle and the part build surface.

This machine is a bed slinger in a box design. The enclosure is highly insulated and actively heated. With high performance polymers the insulation is too effective. Measures to actively remove heat from the build volume are needed to maintain the target air temperature and stay under machine design limits.

## Current Configuration

As detailed in the Ethos of High Temperature Additive Manufacturing there are fundamental material and technology limitations afflicting FDM/FFF machine design, especially when the motion system occupies the build volume (from an environmental standpoint). The highest performing commercial machines separate the two.

The maximum sustainable chamber temperature is currently 135 C. The Spicy CR-10 has machine and enclosure limitations as follows:

- Mechanical - static
    - Frame thermal expansion
    - Frame bi-metallic thermal expansion
    - Build plate heater
- Mechanical - dynamic
    - Drive Belts
    - Ball bearings
    - Lubrication
    - Springs
- Electrical
    - Fan an stepper motor windings
    - Wire
    - Connectors
    - Sensors
- Logistical
    - First layer access
    - Build surface fixturing
    - Material handling and feeding
